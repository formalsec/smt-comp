Generator: VectorCAST 2020sp6, ATG 2.0c-pre
Application: Test-case generation for safety-critical C and C++
Target solver: Z3/CVC4 (with SymFPU)/Bitwuzla (with SymFPU)

These benchmarks were generated using VectorCAST's [1] automated test-case
generation capability, an industrial symbolic execution engine targeted towards
generating high-coverage test-suites for safety-critical C and C++.

While VectorCAST can target multiple SMT solvers via a generic Python API, it
does not support generating SMTLIB2 files directly. Consequently, these
benchmarks were obtained using Z3's [2] 'smtlib2_log' [3] facility to capture
all interactions between VectorCAST and the SMT solver, including all push/pop
commands.

The input to the test-case generator was:

    * A *C* file,

    * which came from project from the *RTOS* market
